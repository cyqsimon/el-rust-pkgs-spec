## el-rust-pkgs-spec

This repository hosts `spec` files for building selected Rust packages
that are not included in major repos (default, EPEL, RPMFusion, etc.)
for Enterprise Linux (RHEL, Rocky, etc.).

You can install the built packages from [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/cyqsimon/el-rust-pkgs).
